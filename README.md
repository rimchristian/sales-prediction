# Sales Predictions

I am trying to help retailers understand the properties and outlets to predict sales. 

## Data:
Data includes a dataset from retailers with the followering dictionaries. 

Attribute |	Description
Item_Identifer | Unique product id
Item_Weight |	Weight of Product
Item_Fat_Content | Whether the product is low fat or regular
Item_Visibility | Percentage of total display area of all products in a store allocated in the particlar product
Item_Type | The cateogry to which the product belongs
Item_MRP | Maximum Retail Price of the product
Outlet_Identifier | Unique store id
Outlet_Establishment_Year | The year in whch store was established
Outlet_Size | The size of the store in terms of ground area covered
Outlet_location_type | The type of area in which the storoe is located
Outlet_Type | Whether the outlet is a grocery store or some sort of supermarket
Item_Outlet_Sales | Sales of the product in the particular store. This is the target variable to be predicted.
